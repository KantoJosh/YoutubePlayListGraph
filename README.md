# YoutubePlayListGraph
Graphs the views of videos in a youtube playlist. Great for tracking popularity of a series (ex. podcasts)
Dependencies:
  Numpy
  Python3.6

Will soon be abstracted to create more utility functions that you can use :)

Will print title + youtube views of each video in the playlist, runs much faster if you disable the printing :)
